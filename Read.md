# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Data Analysis

## Overview
This project uses the UCI HAR dataset to analyze human activity data. The dataset consists of sensor readings from smartphones, and the goal is to classify activities performed by different subjects.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R`: R script to clean and analyze the data.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The resulting tidy dataset, containing averages of each measurement for each subject and activity.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the dataset, variables, and transformations.

## How to Run the Script
1. Download the UCI HAR dataset from the provided link and unzip it.
2. Place the dataset folder (`UCI HAR Dataset`) in the working directory.
3. Run the script `run_analysis.R` in R.
4. The tidy data will be saved in `tidy_data.txt`.
